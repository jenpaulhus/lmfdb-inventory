**Notes**: families collection has been superseded by passports

**Todo**: 
* Add higher genus data.
* Add equations for curves. 


## Collection passports
* **dim**: dimension of the family of curves, this is a non-negative integer
* **genus**: genus of the family of curves, this is a positive integer > 1
* **signature**:  a string representing a list of non-negative integers [g0,m1,...,mr] where g0 is the quotient genus, and the mi represent the orders of the generators of the monodromy group
* **r**: number of branch points of the cover, positive integer
* **g0**: quotient genus,  this is a non-negative integer
* **gen_vectors**: generating vector for this action, stored as r lists of positive integers representing permutations
* **group**: automorphism group, string representing a pair of integers encoding the GAP/Magma group id
* **label**: label for whole family, string of form  'g.a-b.g0.m1-m2-...-mr' where g is genus, a-b is group,  g0 is quotient genus, and m1, ..., mr are remaining r entries in signature
* **passport_label**: label for the passport (numbered by conjugacy class), string of form 'g.a-b.g0.m1-m2-...-mr.x' where x is a positive integer representing the conjugacy class list, and assigned when the data is initially generated by increasing numeric values of the conjugacy classes  
* **total_label**: label including which generating vector, string of form 'g.a-b.g0.m1-m2-...-mr.x.y' where y is a positive integer representing the particular generating vector for a given refined passport, the value is assigned when the data is initially generated in the order the generating vectors are found
* **_id**: mongodb generated
* **hyperelliptic**: True/False whether curve is hyperelliptic
* **hyp_involution**: hyperelliptic involution (if hyperelliptic), stored as list of positive integers representing a permutation
* **cyclic_trigonal**: True/False whether curve is cyclic trigonal
* **cinv**: trigonal automorphism (if cyclic trigonal), sotred as a list of positive intgers representing a permutation
* **signH**: signature of full action, a string representing a list of positive integers for the action of the full automorphism group of this family
* **full_auto**: group id for the full automorphism group for this family, as string representing a pair of integers encoding the GAP/Magma group id
* **full_label**: label for full automorphism group, in same form as label above but for full automorphism group data
* **cc**: ordered pair of positive integers where first number is which refined passport and second is which generating vector for that conjugacy class list
* **con**: list of conjugacy classes where the action for this particular refined passport occurs, stored as a string representing a list of positive integers
* **eqn** string representing an equation for the family, given in LaTeX notation
