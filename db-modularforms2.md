## General notes
* All collections contain the field `_id` which is an object of the type bson.ObjectId and uniquely identifies the record in the database. 
* All collections with names ending with .chunks contain chunks of files for GridFS for the corresponding collection with name ending with .files and will not be further described.
* All collections with names ending with .files contain data for GridFS files and will (or at least *should*) all contain the following fields (which will not be repeted below except 'filename' which has a different format in each collection):

    Example: (25 x 4 dense matrix over Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^4 + 4*zeta12*x^2 + (4*zeta12^3 - 8*zeta12^2 - 8*zeta12 + 4)*x + 6*zeta12^2 - 10 over its base field, (1, (8/37*zeta12^3 - 109/444*zeta12^2 + 6/37*zeta12 + 5/111)*a^3 + (29/111*zeta12^3 - 5/12*zeta12^2 - 61/444*zeta12 + 1/12)*a^2 + (-83/111*zeta12^3 + 139/148*zeta12^2 + 121/444*zeta12 - 53/148)*a - 7/3*zeta12^3 - 293/222*zeta12^2 + 19/6*zeta12 - 244/111, ...))
